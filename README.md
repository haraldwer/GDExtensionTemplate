# GDExtension Template

This template project provides some useful functionality for working with GDExtension in Visual Studio / Rider in Windows. 

## Features
 * A ``.sln`` solution with an example ``.vcxproj`` project
 * Recursive ``SConstruct`` file (allowing for cpp files in subfolders)
 * One-click IDE compilation
 * A pre-compile step that automatically registers classes, members and variables (similar to the unreal UCLASS/UPROPERTY functionality) (WIP)
 * Some useful .bat scripts 

## Prerequsites
 * Godot 4 executable
 * C++ compiler
 * SCons
 * .NETFramework v4.8 (older versions might also work)

See [Compiling Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html#requirements)

## Setup 
 * Clone the repository. If the ``godot-cpp`` folder is empty, try ``--recursive`` when cloning to also get the submodules.
 * Copy godot executable to repository folder and rename to ``godot.exe``.
 * In your IDE, use ``ProjectLauncher`` configuration.

## Usage
Some macros exist in reg.h that provide automated registration for classes, functions and properties. 
Here is how to use them:
 * ``REG_CLASS()`` - Use this macro instead of GDCLASS().
 * ``REG_FUNCTION()`` - Put this in front of your function.
 * ``REG_PROPERTY()`` - Put this in front of your property. Supports ``PropertyInfo`` meta parameters.
 * ``REG_ENUM()`` - Put this in front of your enum.

There is an example class called GDExample that you can use for reference. 
Registration-code will be injected into ``extension.cpp``. Class bindings will be generated based on ``reg_class.template``. 

## Known issues / Future work
 * The debugger does not attach automatically to the godot process. You can still attach manually.

## Notes
 * Intellisense / Intellij will only work after first compile.
 * The ``RegAutomation`` project will compile and run when you compile your c++ code. ``RegAutomation.exe`` is responsible for generating the registration code and you can find the resulting files in ``/source/{project name}/.generated/``. 
 * The ``.sln`` and ``.vcxproj`` is based on the generated result of running ``scons platform=windows vsproj=yes`` in the godot engine repository.
 * NMake .sln requires an exe path without parameters. The ``ProjectLauncher`` project is a workaround for this.
 * I have not yet tested multiple GDExtension projects in the same solution.
 * Tested with Rider 2023.2 and Visual Studio Community 2022.

## Unit Tests

This section assumes that Visual Studio Community 2022 is being used as the IDE of choice.

Unit tests are implemented in the [RegAutomation.Core.Tests](source/RegAutomation/RegAutomation.Core.Tests/) project. This project is included in both [`solution.sln`](source/solution.sln) and [`RegAutomation.sln`](source/RegAutomation/RegAutomation.sln). 

To run unit tests from `solution.sln`, right click on the `RegAutomation.Core.Tests` project in the Solution Explorer, and select `Run Tests`. Do _not_ use `Run All Tests` in `solution.sln`, as this will trigger the build process and cause scons to build the C++ project, wasting several minutes before the tests actually get run.

Alternatively, you can run unit tests from `RegAutomation.sln` instead. This solution does not include `ProjectLauncher` and the C++ project, so you can just select `Test > Run All Tests` from the toolbar to run tests without the aforementioned issues.
